##  âœ¨Have a nice day!âœ¨

I am an aspiring PhD student with a strong interest in computation theory. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematics, computation, logic, and consciousness.

I have previously worked on specific areas including: 
- Artificial Intelligence
  - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
  - Autonomous System (Control, Navigation, Planning)
  - Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)
  - World Models
- Quantum Computing
  - Quantum Circuit Compilation
