##  ✨Have a nice day!✨

I am an aspiring PhD student with a strong interest in Computation Theory & Theoretical Computer Science. My research interests lie at the nature of mathematics and computation, and their convergence with logic, consciousness and intelligence.

I have previously worked on specific areas including:
- Intelligence
  - Artificial Intelligence
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    - Autonomous System (Control, Navigation, Planning)
    - Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)
    - World Models
- Computation
  - Quantum Computing
    - Quantum Circuit Compilation
  - Complexity
  - Biocomputing
